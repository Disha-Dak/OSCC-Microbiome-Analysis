This study investigated the microbial signatures associated with Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) and tobacco users through comprehensive microbiome analysis. Using 16S rRNA sequencing data, we analysed saliva samples from OSCC patients, tobacco users, and healthy controls to identify potential bacterial biomarkers and understand microbial dysbiosis patterns. The analysis revealed distinct bacterial profiles with significant differences in the abundance of key genera. Megasphaera (13.2%), Parvimonas (7.4%), Prevotella (7.1%), and Fusobacterium (6.1%) showed notably higher abundances in OSCC samples. Our logistic regression analysis revealed that Leptotrichia showed the highest positive coefficient (~0.6), followed by Rothia (~0.4), indicating a stronger association with tobacco users(pre-cancerous). Conversely, Parvimonas and Veillonella showed negative coefficients (-0.4), suggesting their reduced association with tobacco users, while Megasphaera, Selenomonas, and Alloprevotella had minimal classification impact.
Machine learning approaches, Logistic Regression (AUC=1.00), successfully differentiated between OSCC and tobacco users based on their microbial signatures. Principal Component Analysis demonstrated clear separation between groups, with bacterial genera like Leptotrichia, Rothia, and Parvimonas emerging as significant contributors to group discrimination. It is to be noted that the sample size is small and needs a dynamic set of data to validate the study. These findings provide insights into the relationship between oral microbiome composition and OSCC development, potentially contributing to early detection strategies and risk assessment in tobacco users(pre-cancerous)
